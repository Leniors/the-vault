
2. App Routing & Metadata
Add proper SEO metadata for each section.

Set up anchor IDs (#products, #about, etc.) for smooth scrolling.

4. Payment Integration
Even dummy checkout looks better with a "Pay with M-PESA" or "Coming Soon" message.

Stripe or M-PESA integration can be added later.
